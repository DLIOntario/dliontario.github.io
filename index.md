We will provide an overview of the steps involved in visualizing Census data in ArcGIS, including data elements and major processes. This session will also feature a critical discussion on visualizing Census data in GIS software, focusing on the technical expertise required to produce usable visualizations as well as the responsibility (and credit) for producing visualizations.
