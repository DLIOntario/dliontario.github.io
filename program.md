Presenter: Ahmed Almaskut, Statistics Canada</b>	
<p>A quick refresher course for those who have had statistical training in the past or a fast-paced introduction to basic statistics for beginners. Statistical measures such as percentages, averages, frequency and standard error are used widely. But how are they calculated, and exactly what do they tell us? This one day workshop will help participants develop an appreciation of the potential of statistics and a critical eye of when and how they should or shouldn't be used.</p>

<b><a name="2-4">1000-1030: OJN 213 - The Data Reference Interview</a><br>
Presenter: Jane Fry</b>
<p>I want some data.” What would you do with this question? How would you determine what the client wants? Does the client really know what they want or will you have to help them decide?  It is essential to determine the needs of the client. The reference interview must be conducted in a professional manner during which active listening must be practiced. As well, any steps you take to answer the client’s request must be explained clearly to them so they will not only understand why you are giving them the answer you are, but they will also be able to replicate the search process on their own, if need be.</p>

<b><a name="2-8a">1345-1500: OJN 213 - Concurrent Workshop A: Mapping the Census Using Open-Source GIS</a><br>
Presenter: Liz Sutherland</b>
<p>Maps have always been a powerful tool for visualizing data. Participants will learn how to link the static data of census tables to census geographies by using open-source GIS software. Participants will learn how to join data, calculate new attributes, symbolize geography and create maps. No prior GIS experience is necessary. QGIS will be required to be downloaded prior to the workshop, and laptops will be required. Download instructions <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html</a></p>

<b><a name="2-8b">1345-1500: OJN 208 - 	Concurrent Workshop B: Analyzing and Managing Data in Excel</a><br>
Presenter: Lise Doucette</b>
<p>Learn a few ways to speed up your work and accomplish tasks that you didn’t know Excel could do.  This workshop will introduce you to functions that allow you to create and customize cross-tabs (pivot tables), find information within large data sets, join two data sets together on a common variable, and use conditional formatting to highlight key information.  The workshop will be led using Excel for Office 365 – participants are asked to bring a laptop with a locally installed version of Excel 2013 or later (many of these functions cannot be accomplished with the online version of Excel).</p>

Presenters: Kristi Thompson, Western University and Lucia Costanzo, University of Guelph</b>
<p>R is an open-source software environment for data manipulation and statistical analysis. Used in a variety of disciplines, R has become a popular tool because of its power, flexibility, and active community. Join us as we teach the R language fundamentals and basic syntax, major R data structures and generate basic descriptive statistics.</p>
	
<p>No programming skills are required for this workshop, just an interest and/or desire to learn. Please bring a laptop for your own use during the workshop. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following:</p>

<b><a name="2-10d">1515-1645: OJN 208 -  Concurrent Workshop D: RTRA: Opening the jail doors -- letting the data out</a><br>
	Presenters: Susan Mowers and Chantal Ripp, University of Ottawa</b>

<p>Participants will use RTRA to link data on crimes with those involved in crimes to create original tables not available through the DLI. This workshop will show participants how to use RTRA to link and describe crime from the circumstances and characteristics of crimes, together with the basic demographics and charges for all accused, and for violent crimes, the basic demographics of the victim(s) of a crime and their relationship(s) to the accused. The data is from the Uniform Crime Report survey, virtually a 100% sample of police-reported criminal violations. This workshop is particularly timely as students and researchers of all backgrounds will soon be able to retrieve this RTRA data using the GUI interface now in testing.</p>

<p>This session follows four themes. First, it will describe the RDC, the principal data it supports and the application process. Second, it will discuss the growth in administrative and linked administrative data files being made available by Statistics Canada. Third, it will highlight some of the pilot data, particularly business related, that the RDC hosts. The session concludes with a discussion on how the McMaster RDC and Data Services (DLI) has worked together to promote the use of data on campus to meet the needs of researchers.</p>

Presenters: Leanne Trimble, University of Toronto and Susan Mowers, University of Ottawa</b>

<p>OCUL’s Historical Census Working Group (part of the OCUL Data Community) is working on scoping a comprehensive bilingual inventory of Canadian census data. Our dream is to eventually build a bilingual and openly available discovery platform for census data & statistical tables (print & digital) going back to the earliest Canadian censuses. This presentation will provide a status update on the project and dedicate time for attendees to discuss the project and provide input.</p>
